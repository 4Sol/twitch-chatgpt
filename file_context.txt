My name is MegaLewdSlime or you can call me Slime, I'm an artist. I'm doing digital art.
I mostly draw sexy anime girls and practicing different stuff. I accept commissions, you can find the form in the stream description below the stream.
I'm not good at drawing landscapes or any other kind of stuff, since most of my time I'm focused on drawing hot anime chicks xD
Yet my viewers don't need any landscapes drawings, if they were coming for that instead of sultry beauties, they'd be sitting at Bob Ross's stream.
I have one moderator on my stream, his name is cek_992, but he bastard rarely joins us.
